# Maxwell's Equations

Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields.

## Differential Form

1. **Gauss's Law**:
   $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} $$

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:
   $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 $$

3. **Faraday's Law**:
   $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} $$

4. **Ampère's Law (with Maxwell correction)**:
   $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J} + \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right) $$

## Covariant Form

In relativistic notation, using the electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$:

$$
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = \mu_0 J^\nu
$$

And the Bianchi identity:

$$
\partial_{[\lambda} F_{\mu\nu]} = 0
$$
