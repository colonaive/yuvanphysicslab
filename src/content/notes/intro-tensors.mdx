# Introduction to Tensors

Tensors are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors.

## Definition

A tensor $T$ of type $(k, l)$ can be thought of as a multi-linear map:

$$
T: \underbrace{V^* \times \dots \times V^*}_{k} \times \underbrace{V \times \dots \times V}_{l} \to \mathbb{R}
$$

## Einstein Summation

We use the convention where repeated indices imply summation:

$$
A_i B^i = \sum_{i} A_i B^i
$$

## Metric Tensor

The metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ defines the geometry of space-time. The line element is:

$$
ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
$$

This is a fundamental concept in General Relativity.
