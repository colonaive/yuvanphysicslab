      body:
        "General relativity offers a precise language for connecting gravity, geometry, and causality. I am especially drawn to how local measurements and global topology can lead to profoundly different physical interpretations.",

        "CTCs expose edge-cases of causality that force careful reasoning about what is mathematically allowed versus what is physically plausible. They provide a focused way to study chronology, consistency, and the limits of spacetime models.",
