# Geometric Deep Learning Foundations

Geometric Deep Learning attempts to generalized neural networks to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds.

## Symmetry Groups

The core idea is to respect the symmetry of the domain. For example, CNNs respect translational symmetry.

$$
f(T_g x) = T_g f(x)
$$

This is the condition of equivariance.

## Applications in Physics

We can apply this to:
1. Molecular dynamics (SE(3) symmetry)
2. Gauge theories (SU(N) symmetry)
