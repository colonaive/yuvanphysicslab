## Introduction

An overview of closed timelike curves (CTCs), their role in relativistic spacetime models, and the broader causality questions they raise.

## Time

### Coordinate Time

How coordinate choices affect the interpretation of chronology in curved manifolds.

### Proper Time

Local observer clocks and the distinction between local and global notions of temporal evolution.

### Global Time Functions

Conditions under which a global time function can be defined, and how CTCs obstruct such formulations.

## Energy Conditions

A concise review of energy conditions relevant to CTC-supporting geometries and what they imply for physical plausibility.
